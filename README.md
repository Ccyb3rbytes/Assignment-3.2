Start Assignment
• Due Nov 3 by 11:59pm
 
• Points 50
 
• Submitting a text entry box, a website url, or a file upload
COURSE OBJECTIVES:
• Demonstrate basic formal problem-solving techniques for programming.
• Describe and apply variables, basic and composite data types, and collections.  
• Develop basic and common algorithms using the elements of structured programming.
• Use loops and conditionals in a program.
• Create simple functions that accept parameters and return results.
• Demonstrate effective troubleshooting, testing, and debugging, of programs. 
Objectives:
Palindromes are words that are spelled the same forward or backward, for example, "radar". For the assignment, you will ask the user to enter a word or phrase and then you will check to see if the letters are the same forward and backward.
Requirements:
• Create a new page called strings.html
• Add a prompt for the user to enter a string.  
• Add a button to check for palindrome.
•  notify the user if the string was a palindrome or not,
• Check if the string is spelled the same forwards and backward (hint, remove the spaces before checking).
• Have at least 2 creative elements – images, fonts, background color, etc. 
• Create a nice look and feel for the user and make a great user experience!
• Comment above almost every line of your code, both HTML and JavaScript!
• Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
• Take one or more screen prints of your application running.
Deliverable:
• Submit GitHub repo address.
• Submit a print screen of your application running.
